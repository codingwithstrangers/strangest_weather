### Strangest Weather

Before we get into the details, a few disclaimers: This is part of my training exercise for a self-paced homework assignment. If you want to use this, feel free!

### What is This?

This is a template for creating a responsive weather app. The goal is to enter a city and get the weather in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

### Why Did I Do This?

Practice! This was my first weather app, and I did it as a learning exercise.

### How Users Can Use This

**For Users:**
- Import the project to your system.
- Open the HTML file in a browser.
- Done!

**For Programmers:**
- I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS—no frameworks. I know, right?
- You can replace all images and links.
- Check the "Bugs" section for any issues I’m aware of.
- The JS code handles data retrieval and DOM manipulation.

- `gitignore` - was going to make backend server to story keys, but that was out of scope

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).

### Bugs

Feel free to submit issues, fork the repository, and make pull requests. Your contributions are welcome! Since I might not address these bugs myself, I’ll probably try to rebuild this in React. Here are the known bugs:

- [ ] API call out to weather source not used, due to financial requirements, feel free to use free weath api and finish
- [ ] I am using grid to make the app responisve but the scope was for the API the media@ are setup if you want to use them
